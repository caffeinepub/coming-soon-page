  "summary": "The diff implements a Coming Soon landing page with dark theme, amber/gold accents, animations, background image, responsive layout, and friendly messaging — satisfying both REQ-1 and REQ-2. All acceptance criteria appear to be addressed. The background image is referenced as a static asset path correctly. No missing requirements were found, but some unrequested features were added.",
